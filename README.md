#Reallllly basic bash CLI for [Remember the Milk][milk]

The only thing you'll need to install is [jq][jq], for working with JSON in bash. Of course, you can always figure out the XML stuff, but... It isn't like that's necessarily easier. Sort of a 'pick your poison' situation.

You'll also need [your own API keys][api] because I haven't included mine here.

I think other than [jq][jq], all other tools are the ones you generally find in a \*nix environment.

Also noteworthy is that, yeah, I make pretty consistent use of the /tmp/ dir. Sue me, I find it easier and all the files are small and get cleaned out whenever you reboot.
